audience after audience, there was a dark side to his youth on the big screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000284406315-e1583311091123.jpg><h2><strong>Who is Corey Feldman and what is his background?</strong></h2><p>Corey Feldman is a 48-year-old actor, singer and former child star who became an icon through his 80s movies.</p><p>Born to musician father Bob and former Playboy model mother Sheila in California in 1971, Feldman has a sister and two younger brothers.</p><p>He started his acting career at the tender age of three when he appeared in a McDonald’s advert and soon after had bit parts in various TV shows including Mork And Mindy and Cheers.</p><p>But it was just a warm-up for the international fame that was just round the corner.</p><img

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000284504103-e1479995167692.jpg><h2>Does Corey Feldman have a documentary out?</h2><p>On March 2, 2020, Corey Feldman announced that he would be screening his documentary My Truth: The Rape Of Two Coreys, which chronicles the emotional and sexual abuse he and Corey Haim endured in Hollywood.</p><p>The screening will air in the US on March 9 and worldwide on March 10, 2020.</p><p>You can <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pay to watch it here</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000284509989.jpg><h2>What films has Corey Feldman appeared in?</h2><p>From the mid to the late 80s, there didn’t seem to be a film out that Corey wasn’t starring in.</p><p>From Gremlins to The Goonies, to Stand By Me and The Lost Boys, Corey was loved for his cute face, his comic timing and his cheeky one-liners.</p><p>He voiced Young Copper in Disney's The Fox And The Hound in 1981 and from there he took over the silver screen in movies like Gremlins, Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter and The 'Burbs.</p><p>He regularly starred alongside his best friend Corey Haim, and they became known as “The Two Coreys” after their work in Lost Boys, License To Drive and Dream a Little Dream.</p><p>The 90s were also fruitful for Corey's career as he starred in movies like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Stepmonster, National Lampoon's Last Resort and Red Line.</p><p>What fans may not know is he also directed a 1997 movie called Busted and was forced to fire his friend Corey Haim when he kept failing to turn up on set.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000000828576.jpg><h2>What happened between Corey Feldman and Michael Jackson?</h2><p>Feldman and megastar Michael Jackson became friends at the height of Feldman’s film career in the late 80s and even went to Disneyland in disguise so they wouldn’t be recognised.</p><p>During the allegations of child abuse against Jackson, Corey stuck by him and claimed the singer never acted inappropriately around him or tried to touch him.</p><p>But in an interview with British journalist Martin Bashir in 2005, he said he was at Jackson’s home when he was about 13 and there was a book on the coffee table featuring naked men and women.</p><p>He told Bashir he didn't consider the nude pictures "a big deal," but became concerned because of the current molestation charges.</p><p>Corey Feldman says he can no longer defend Michael Jackson after details of the singer's alleged sexual abuse of two boys was revealed in Leaving Neverland.<br>The actor, who previously refuted the allegations against his "best pal", said he couldn't stand by "anyone accused of such horrendous crimes".</p><img

they divorced in 1993.</p><p>Then in January 2002 he met actress and model Susie Sprague and they married that October, before they had son Zen in 2005.</p><p>Corey and Susie divorced in 2014 after a five-year court battle.</p><p>In November 2016, he married his long-term girlfriend Courtney Anne in Las Vegas.</p><p>She is one of his Corey’s Angels, a group of scantily-clad&nbsp;back-up performers who wear wings and halos during their appearances with the star.</p><p>Corey said he created Corey’s Angels as a way to help young women break into the entertainment industry, adding that the women must move into his house and abide by his rules in the “Feldmansion.”</p><p>The women are expected to adhere to a strict vegetarian diet, mandatory exercise, and no male visitors on the property unless they are previously invited guests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

(£2.5million).</p><p>He has earned most of his wealth&nbsp;from his acting in film and TV shows.</p><p>His stardom meant that when he was 15 he was granted emancipation from his parents, and stated
