She only has 27 minutes to do this interview during her lunch break, she explains, and her water bottle just rolled under a car. Now, she's trying to catch it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The clock is ticking — down to 26 minutes, then to 25 — but I'm not too upset. It's a relatable moment, and that's sort of Olsen's overall vibe. On the set of <i>InStyle</i>'s photo shoot, she reminded me a bit of that girl from high school — the one who was cool, but still friends with everyone. For a moment, you're able to forget that the actress is related to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>mega-famous twins</a>, or stars in Marvel movies (plus an upcoming <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow><i>WandaVision</i> TV show</a>), or is an executive producer on her Facebook Watch series, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3><i>Sorry For Your Loss</i></a>, in which she also plays the lead.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dress, Khaite; Shoes, Jimmy Choo.

I recently spent hours sobbing into my phone while watching nearly two seasons of Olsen as Leigh, a young woman experiencing the many stages of grief after the death of her husband. It's not exactly a lighthearted show, but there are a few funny moments and complicated (yet highly intriguing) love stories.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We really wanted to focus on the smallest of moments in season one," Olsen explains, making me recall how Leigh struggled to return to her job or celebrate her birthday. "But in season two, we wanted Leigh to start off in a different place. The thing that I really wanted to work on with Kit [Steinkellner, the show's writer and creator], was this feeling of momentum and propulsion forward. We try to take bigger risks and make bigger mistakes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As someone who is fully caught up on the show — which is currently on season two; a new episode is released every Tuesday — I can confidently say there are a lot of gasp-worthy moments. Risks and mistakes, especially on Leigh's end, are aplenty.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Coat and Boots, Gabriela Hearst. Photo by Emma Anderson.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What wasn't a mistake, however, was having Olsen work behind the camera on the series, not just in front of. During our call, she talks at length about the experience — how much she enjoys being part of the creative process, from first draft to final cut; how she's finally confident enough to give honest opinions; how she feels like she's adding value. People will probably think this is boring, she tells me, but it's nice to hear how dedicated and passionate the star is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's exhausting and you don't get weekends," she adds, going over her schedule, which lasts 10 months (as opposed to the four it takes to film). "It's not just memorizing lines or doing your character study. You're trying to make sure certain outlines sound good for three episodes from now, or that drafts look good, or edits. You give notes on that. It's a much busier experience than just getting to be an actor, but it's really fulfilling."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yet despite Olsen's love of her job, she isn't the type to spend hours in front of the TV.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I watch a lot of sports, because it's fall and sports are always on," she says, shocking me after I ask what shows she likes. Still, Olsen does enjoy a good binge. "I've been watching <i>The Sopranos</i>, but I had to take a break because it was giving me nightmares. And I devoured Killing Eve and Fleabag. I loved <i>Game of Thrones</i> and I'm sad it's gone."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She then asks if I've ever heard of <i>Riverdale</i> (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I have</a>), revealing that, somehow, she just found out it existed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've never watched it, I just know it's a thing. And apparently, it's a very big thing, too."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Suit, Dior; Shoes, Gabriela Hearst. Photo by Emma Anderson.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, any conversation with an Olsen must include some talk of fashion. The actress describes her everyday style as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>masculine and oversize</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Dresses make me feel a bit funny. I'm trying to get more confident with my feminine side," she tells me. "I just like everything to feel really easy and comfortable. Nothing fussy. I don't like body-conscious clothing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The outfit that she's wearing during our call — "oversize black cotton pants, a black button-up, and flats" — is what she considers her dream look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel very comfortable, but I don't look sloppy. I look like I have a point of view and an opinion."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Coat, Top, Pants, and Bag, Bottega Veneta. Photo by Emma Anderson.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With only a few minutes left to talk, I ask Olsen, who turned 30 this year, what she's learned as she gets older.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think I was always trying to distract myself from being still," she says, reflecting on her younger years. "I feel like I cared about self-improvement in high school and then, in college, I was trying to get too many things done and not being as present as I think I could have been."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On that ironic note, our interview time is up. Olsen has to rush back to film...something. Unfortunately, she's unable to say what.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm so sorry that I cursed a bunch at the beginning of our conversation," she blurts out just before hanging up, explaining the whole water-bottle situation again. I tell her not to worry — it's happened to all of us — and that I hope her day gets less busy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't think so," Olsen says with a laugh. "But that's okay."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i>Photographs by Emma Anderson, assisted by Katie Tucker and Jeremy Gould. Styled by Laurel Pantin.
