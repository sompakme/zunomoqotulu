Even though many details of the monarch's fortune are kept private, it is believed that Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family's net worth is in the millions - approximately £402 million as of 2016, according to . Despite being the Queen of the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, she is also Head of the Commonwealth and is also the Royal Patron of more than 600 charities.</p><p id=eMVN5DZKYtYs data-wc=103>Buckingham Palace, is the most iconic royal residence. The Queen was christened here in 1926. Eighty-five years later, she hosted the Obamas and has held countless royal events. Her administrative residence attracts millions of tourists every year and is undoubtedly one of London's main attractions. The Queen is also the owner of the Duchy of Lancaster private estate, which includes patches of central London and much of rural England and Wales. She is also the legal owner of the Crown Estate, which is now a private company. According to Brand Finance, the royal family contributes nearly £1.8bn to the UK economy each year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27f482c9c59c-the-queen-ascot-z.jpg><h2>Other properties</h2><p id=eNrJzGZbhfPA data-wc=91>Balmoral Castle is where the Queen and her family head to in the summer. The Queen usually starts her summer holiday in mid-July, but while the Scotland-based castle is officially open to tourists until August, she stays in a seven-bedroom stone house on her estate, Craigowan Lodge. She then moves into the 'big house' in August and stays in Scotland until September/October time. During the winter months, the Queen will spend Christmas and New Year at Sandringham House in Norfolk; this 8,000-hectare estate was originally bought by Queen Victoria in 1862.</p><p id=eqk4VRqffs61 data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Why the Queen and the royal family stopped celebrating Christmas at Windsor Castle</a></strong></p><p id=eqq5d8GyzbK7 data-wc=54>Windsor Castle is the world's largest occupied castle but for the Queen it's a "weekend home." It is the oldest and largest occupied castles in the world, and has hosted several royal weddings - including <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Meghan Markle</a>'s May nuptials. A 1992 fire destroyed more than 100 rooms, resulting in five years of painstaking restorations.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><h2>Horse winnings</h2><p id=eWrKwXQ3iBt9 data-wc=72>Over the past 30 years, the Queen has earned a total of £6,704,941 from her horses. According to data compiled by , Her Majesty recorded 451 race wins with a win percentage of 15.9 per cent in this period. In 2016, she banked a whopping £557,650 - her highest annual total winning ever. Last year she earnt £413,641. It is understood that the majority of the winnings go to the horses' trainers.</p><h2>The Queen's family life</h2><p id=e7WfQCHTn7WC data-wc=79>The monarch was a 21-year-old Princess when she married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten at Westminster Abbey on 20th November 1947. The couple originally met at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in 1939 when the Queen was just 13 years old, and began exchanging letters before eventually becoming formally engaged in 1947, following Elizabeth's 21st birthday. The monarch was crowned just five years after their wedding following the death of her father King George VI, who died aged only 56.</p><p id=eL8HmV1ZZlG8 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The Queen and Prince Philip's love story in pictures</a></strong></p><p id=eZL0CdLJ7a1t data-wc=103>The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh welcomed their first son Prince Charles in 1948, and two years later, the Queen gave birth to Princess Anne. The royal couple then went on to welcome their third and fourth children - Princes Andrew and Edward almost a decade later. The Queen is the nation's longest reigning sovereign, having overtaken the record set by Queen Victoria, and is the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary. During her reign, the Queen has seen 12 Prime Ministers come and go, witnessed dramatic social and technological change and had to choose between family and duty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a88824d2bcc6-the-queen-and-prince-philip-engaged-z.jpg><h2>When was the Queen's coronation?</h2><p id=eOzXWnathMPl data-wc=111>It's been 65 years since the Queen's coronation, and it was the first British coronation to be televised. Earlier this year, the Queen spoke about her 1953 coronation in a documentary, in which she highlighted her struggle wearing the Imperial State Crown. "Fortunately, my father and I have about the same sort of shaped head," she said. "But once you put it on, it stays. I mean, it just remains on. You can't look down to read the speech, you have to take the speech up. Because if you did your neck would break, it would fall off. So there are some disadvantages to crowns, but otherwise they’re quite important things."</p><p id=ecsbE44zCn6o data-wc=72>She added: "It's the sort of, I suppose, the beginning of one's life really as a sovereign. It is sort of a pageant of chivalry and old-fashioned way of doing things, really. I've seen one coronation and been the recipient in the other, which is pretty remarkable." Geoffrey Fisher, the Archbishop of Canterbury, presented the Queen with the Sceptre with the Cross during her coronation, a day filled with pomp and pageantry.</p><p id=e12crLHbrx6v data-wc=23></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
