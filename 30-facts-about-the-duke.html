He graduated in Geography in 2005.</p><p>7) He was hit around the head with a golf club when he was a child, leaving his with a “Harry Potter-style” scar on his forehead</p><p>8) He was hailed a hero shortly after qualifying as a search and rescue pilot, saving the life of a man suffering chest pains while stuck on a mountain in stormy weather</p><p>9) The couple only informed the Queen and the Prince of Wales of their engagement two hours before it was made public.</p><p>10) His star sign is Cancer, a water sign. According to astrologists, Cancerians are noted for their sensitivity, which is usually directed towards those closest and dearest to them. People born under the star sign are said to be driven by the need to nurture and happy knack of making other people feel special. They are also believed to be “usually family orientated and have a strong sense of their place in the world.”</p><p>11) His colleagues at RAF Valley in Anglesey in Wales play pranks on him at work. One said: "We've spent a few pounds on Kate and William memorabilia and strategically secreted it around the place so he might open a locker and find stuff, or find his own face on a cushion or see his own face on a cup when you give him a cup of tea.'</p><p>12) Apparently, William and Kate’s favourite song is "I Like The Way You Move" by the Bodyrockers.</p><p>13) His many female admirers include reality TV’s Amy Childs, actress Eva Longoria and model Miranda Kerr, who have all publicly proclaimed their affection for him.</p><p>14) At the tender age of 14, Prince William was said to announce he fancied Emma Bunton from the Spice Girls, replacing Pamela Anderson in his affections</p><p>15) He admits to being a less-than-perfect dancer, claiming modestly that his wife "would dance me under the tables".</p><p>16) Hobbies as a child included skiing, tennis, soccer, hockey, rafting, rowing, and shooting.</p><p>17) He has several pubs named in his honour, with “Prince William” inns in Spain and Majorca and dozens of “Duke of Cambridge” pubs across Britain.</p><p>18) In his younger days, he was reported to drink Stella Artois and sambuca shots in clubs, as well as the more upmarket cocktails of London’s exclusive bars</p><p>19) If he was invisible for a day, he said: "I'd probably get myself in a lot of trouble. I'd probably go into the newspaper office, and I'd hide in the background and listen to all the stories they talk about me."</p><p>20) He once attempted to detract attention from himself while in a nightclub in Bournemouth, telling strangers his name was “Danny” and he “often gets mistaken for William”.</p><p>21) Unlike his younger brother, he has managed to steer clear of scandal for the most part. In a rare negative encounter with the tabloids, he was photographed “groping” a 24-year-old Brazilian girl while in a nightclub in Bournemouth, Dorset, with friends. She claimed he “brushed” her breast while posing for a picture.</p><p>22) A second photograph from the same night, where he posed with 23-year-old Lisa Agar, has been credited by some as helping to reconcile William and his then ex-girlfriend Kate Middleton, by making her jealous.</p><p>23) His wedding was watched by 24.5m people in the UK, and an estimated two billion people around the world.</p><p>24) He enjoys low-key trips to cinema, and has been spotted watching The Avengers, The Inbetweeners, Bridesmaids and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two.</p><p>25) There are currently nearly 3,500 “Prince William” items listed for sale on the UK version of eBay, including face masks, historic newspapers and a commemorative spoon.</p><p>26) His favourite cake is said to be the “chocolate biscuit cake”, using rich tea biscuits and dark chocolate, which is cooled in the fridge rather than baked. He had a version made for his wedding.</p><p>27) He admits he is not the world's best cook, saying: "When I was trying to impress Kate I was trying to cook these amazing fancy dinners and what would happen was I would burn something, something would overspill, something would catch fire."</p><p>28) He confessed he barely slept the night before his wedding, due to excitement, nerves and the noise of the crowds outside, and was worried about tripping down the steps in his spurs</p><p>29) He wanted to be a policeman when he was younger, before deciding to join the army and settling on training to be a search and rescue helicopter pilot</p><p>30) He believes he could beat Prince Harry in an arm wrestle, saying “it’s not even a contest”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwwcqnnLCrX6W%2FqrrCnmSwoZyhtqK5jnJqbW5haIZwnNGipZydXYy2rbjImqSsZWNlwal5waKpraCUlsZuf49mnZqbpKh6oq7OrqtmrJiaeoXByp5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f30-facts-about-the-duke.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f30-facts-about-the-duke.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f30-facts-about-the-duke.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f30-facts-about-the-duke.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f30-facts-about-the-duke.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f30-facts-about-the-duke.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./advantages-of-python-over-other-programming-languages.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./advantages-of-python-over-other-programming-languages.html>Advantages Of Python Over Other Programming Languages</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-alicia-villarreal-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-and-rumours.html>Who is Alicia Villarreal Dating Now?
