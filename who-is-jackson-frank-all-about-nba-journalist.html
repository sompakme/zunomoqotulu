<time>03 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Jackson Frank</strong> is an American sports journalist who covers the NBA, with a focus on the Philadelphia 76ers. He has written for various outlets such as Dime UPROXX, SB Nation, The Athletic, and PhillyVoice.com. He is also a podcast host and a former track and field athlete.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Age_Birthday_Bio></span><strong>Age, Birthday & Bio</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jackson Frank was born in Portland, Oregon, on June 12, 1998. He attended Central Catholic High School, where he was a star athlete in track and field, as well as cross country. He won several state titles and set school records in distance running events. As per some media sources, Jackson is around 25 years old (as of 2023).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Educational_Background></span><strong>Educational Background </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Frank graduated from Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, in 2020. He majored in journalism and public relations and minored in sports management. He was a member of the Gonzaga Bulletin staff, where he wrote about various topics such as music, movies, and sports. He also interned at The Spokesman-Review, a daily newspaper in Spokane.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career_and_Achievements></span><strong>Career and Achievements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Frank started his professional career as a freelance writer for Dime UPROXX, a basketball website that covers the NBA and its culture. He wrote features, analyses, and opinion pieces on various topics related to the league and its players.</p><p>He then joined SB Nation as a staff writer for Liberty Ballers, a website that covers the Philadelphia 76ers. He provided in-depth coverage of the team’s news, games, and transactions. He also hosted a podcast called The Stepover Pod, where he discussed the Sixers with other writers and guests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jackson-Franks-LinkedIn-1024x531.jpg><p>In 2021, Frank moved to The Athletic, a subscription-based sports website that offers high-quality journalism and storytelling. He was part of the NBA staff, covering the league as a whole with a focus on the Sixers. He wrote long-form features, analyses, and columns on various aspects of the game.</p><p>In September 2023, Frank was hired by PhillyVoice.com as the new Sixers beat writer. He replaced Kyle Neubeck, who left to join PHLY Sports, a startup media company owned by ALLCITY Network. Frank was expected to provide daily coverage of the team’s news, games, and stories.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Controversy_and_Firing></span><strong>Controversy and Firing</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>However, Jackson Frank’s tenure at PhillyVoice.com was short-lived. On October 9th, 2023, he was fired by the company after he criticized the Sixers’ statement regarding the ongoing conflict in Israel.</p><p>The Sixers had posted a tweet that expressed their support for Israel following Hamas’ surprise attack over the weekend that killed more than 900 people. The tweet read:</p><p>We stand with Israel and condemn these senseless attacks on innocent lives lost to terrorism. Our thoughts are with all those affected by this violence.</p><p>Frank was not happy with the Sixers’ statement and made it known on social media. He quote-tweeted the post with the message:</p><p>This post sucks! Solidarity with Palestine always.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jackson-Franks-Tweet.jpg><p>Frank’s tweet sparked a lot of backlash from fans and media members who accused him of being anti-Semitic and insensitive. Some also questioned his professionalism and credibility as a journalist.</p><p>PhillyVoice.com was quick to dismiss Frank’s views on the issue and fired him immediately. The company’s CEO Hal Donnelly released a statement regarding Frank’s tweet:</p><p>Mr. Frank is no longer employed by PhillyVoice.com as of today.&nbsp;We stand with everyone who is absolutely outraged by the senseless attacks in Israel by Hamas terrorists, who have killed hundreds of innocent civilians.</p><p>Frank declined to comment on his firing and deleted his Twitter account shortly after. He has not posted anything on his Instagram account since then either.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=NBA_reporter_loses_job_over_anti-Israel_Tweet></span><strong>NBA reporter loses job over anti-Israel Tweet</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has sparked a wave of reactions from various sectors of society, including sports. The NBA, which has a history of social activism and social justice initiatives, has seen some of its teams and players express their views on the situation in the Middle East.</p><p>On October 9, 2023, the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://nypost.com/2023/10/09/76ers-beat-writer-out-at-phillyvoice-after-ripping-teams-israel-tweet/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia 76ers posted a tweet </a>that read: “We stand with the people of Israel and join them in mourning the hundreds of innocent lives lost to terrorism at the hands of Hamas. #StandWithIsrael”. The tweet was in reference to the recent attacks by Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, that killed more than 800 Israelis and nine Americans in multiple towns in southern Israel. Israel responded by launching a bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 500 Palestinians, and imposing a total blockade on the enclave.</p><p>The tweet by the 76ers sparked controversy and backlash from many people who accused the team of ignoring the plight of the Palestinians and supporting Israel’s aggression. Among those who criticized the tweet was Jackson Frank, who had recently joined PhillyVoice as the new Sixers beat writer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened></span><strong>What Happened</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Frank, who had been covering the Sixers for less than a month, quoted the team’s tweet and wrote: “This post sucks! Solidarity with Palestine always.” His tweet was seen by many as an expression of support for the Palestinian cause and a condemnation of Israel’s actions.</p><p>However, his tweet also caught the attention of his employer, PhillyVoice, who did not share his opinion. The same day, PhillyVoice CEO Hal Donnelly issued a statement announcing that Frank was no longer employed by the company. Donnelly said: “We stand with everyone who is absolutely outraged by the senseless attacks in Israel, by the loss of innocent lives and violence against civilians.” He added: “Mr. Frank is no longer employed by PhillyVoice.com as of today.”</p><p>Frank declined to comment on his firing but deleted his X account shortly after. He had previously written for various outlets such as The Athletic, Dime Magazine, and Liberty Ballers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Reactions></span><strong>Reactions</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The firing of Frank sparked a debate on social media and among NBA fans and journalists. Some defended Frank’s right to express his personal views and criticized PhillyVoice for silencing him. Others supported PhillyVoice’s decision and argued that Frank’s tweet was unprofessional and insensitive.</p><p>Some notable NBA figures also weighed in on the issue. CJ McCollum, the president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) and a vocal advocate for social justice, tweeted: “This is unacceptable. Journalists should be able to voice their opinions without fear of losing their jobs. The NBA Social Justice Coalition stands with Jackson Frank and all journalists who speak up for human rights.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jackson-Frank-wiki.jpg><p>Doc Rivers, the head coach of the Sixers and a board member of the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition, had a different perspective. He said: “I respect Jackson as a writer, but I disagree with his tweet. I think it was disrespectful to our organization and our fans. We have a strong relationship with Israel and we support their right to defend themselves from terrorism. I think PhillyVoice made the right call.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Implications></span><strong>Implications</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The firing of Jackson Frank raises questions about the role and responsibility of NBA reporters in covering social and political issues. It also exposes the tensions and divisions within the NBA community over the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p><p>On one hand, some argue that NBA reporters should be able to express their personal views on any topic, especially when it involves human rights and social justice. They claim that reporters have a duty to inform and educate their audience about the realities and complexities of global issues. They also point out that reporters are not robots or mouthpieces for their employers or teams, but human beings with opinions and emotions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Girlfriend_Wife></span><strong>Girlfriend & Wife </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Frank is married to Sarah Frank (née Smith), whom he met at Gonzaga University. They tied the knot in August 2020 in a small ceremony due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They live in Philadelphia with their dog named Cooper.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_worth></span><strong>Net worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Frank’s net worth is estimated to be around $150,000 as of 2023. He earns his income from his writing gigs, podcast hosting, and other endorsements. He is also an avid reader and a fan of indie music.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jackson_Frank_NBA_WIKI_BIO></span><strong>Jackson Frank NBA WIKI, BIO</strong><span
