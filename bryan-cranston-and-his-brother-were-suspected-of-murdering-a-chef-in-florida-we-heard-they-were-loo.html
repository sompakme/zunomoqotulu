The actor plays a man who radically changes his life after learning that he has cancer and goes from being a good, quiet person who makes a living as a high school teacher to a methamphetamine manufacturer.</p><p>Curiously enough, long before filming this series, Cranston was in trouble with the law, as was his successful character. It all started in the 1970s, when Cranston and his brother Kyle decided to go on a two-year motorbike trip across the <strong>United States</strong>. To make it happen, the two of them worked their way across the different states to earn money. One day they ended up waiting tables at a restaurant in Daytona Beach.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>The chef at the restaurant where Bryan Cranston and his brother worked died</h2><p>Bryan himself told 'The Tonight Show' that the chef at the restaurant, <strong>Peter Wong</strong>, was despicable and treated the employees badly. As a result, many of his co-workers joked about killing the chef.</p><p>"We travelled to Florida, in the winter, made all the money we could and worked at a place called the Hawaiian Inn. And at the Hawaiian Inn there was a man, the chef, who was the worst man on the face of the earth. His name was Peter Wong and no matter how good you were to him, he hated you. So we waiters used to sit around and talk about killing Peter Wong," the actor explained.</p><p>But one day, the chef was murdered. The authorities became suspicious of Bryan and Kyle Cranston, who left that day to continue their motorbike trip.</p><p>"At the end of the season, in the spring, my brother and I took the bikes and headed north. At that very moment, Peter disappeared. He was found dead. The police came to the Hawaiian Inn and said 'Has anyone here talked about killing Peter Wong?' Everybody was like 'uhm...' 'Ok, has anybody who's not here anymore talked about it?' And they said the Cranston brothers had left on their motorbikes. We heard they were looking for us."</p><p>In the end, the performer did not tell in the interview how the investigation into the murder suspects ended, but the police proved that the Cranston brothers were innocent</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6trWarmKTEtHuRaWlsZ2BsfHN8jm9rm3CWm4B1gJVqbWyeY2V%2BeYTBbWxxbV6dwa64</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbryan-cranston-and-his-brother-were-suspected-of-murdering-a-chef-in-florida-we-heard-they-were-loo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbryan-cranston-and-his-brother-were-suspected-of-murdering-a-chef-in-florida-we-heard-they-were-loo.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbryan-cranston-and-his-brother-were-suspected-of-murdering-a-chef-in-florida-we-heard-they-were-loo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbryan-cranston-and-his-brother-were-suspected-of-murdering-a-chef-in-florida-we-heard-they-were-loo.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbryan-cranston-and-his-brother-were-suspected-of-murdering-a-chef-in-florida-we-heard-they-were-loo.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbryan-cranston-and-his-brother-were-suspected-of-murdering-a-chef-in-florida-we-heard-they-were-loo.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-bishop-don-magic-juan-make-latest-bishop-don-magic-juan-net-worth-income-salary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-bishop-don-magic-juan-make-latest-bishop-don-magic-juan-net-worth-income-salary.html>How Much Money Does Bishop Don Magic Juan Make?
