She recently announced that she was going to t<a href=# rel>ake on a new acting role</a>. White will be taking part in a touring stage production of B*A*P*S. The play is based on the 1997 film of the same name, which stars Halle Berry. Additionally, she has been to a cosmetic surgeon to undo many of her previous procedures. She said that she wanted her face to look natural. A large part of White's transformation has been due to religion. Some, however, think that she is simply putting on a show for publicity. Tokyo Toni, Angela White's mother, <a href=# rel>even made a public statement about it.</a> White is now facing allegations of buying a degree.</p><p>Angela White, a well-known model, entrepreneur, and social media personality, initially gained fame as a stripper and through high-profile relationships with rapper <a href=# class=text-word rel>Tyga</a> and reality TV star Rob Kardashian. She has made a name for herself as a model for various brands and has ventured into entrepreneurship by launching her own beauty products and a line of sex toys. White has also appeared on several reality TV shows, including her own series, The Real Blac Chyna. However, she has recently made the decision to <a href=# rel>distance herself from her previous involvement in OnlyFans</a> and stripping, which were once prominent aspects of her public image. She cites her desire to be a positive role model for her children as the driving force behind this lifestyle change.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-angela-white-s-liberate-arts-degree>Angela White's "Liberate Arts" Degree</h2></span><p>Raqi Thunda, radio personality and former Love & Hip Hop star, has accused Angela White of buying a degree. In January, White announced that she had received her Doctorate of Liberal Arts from the Sacramento Theological Seminary and Bible College. In her post about the accomplishment, she stated that she received her Doctorate in "Liberate" Arts. She signed off the post as "Dr. Angela Renee White". Raqi was quick to call the spelling error out. In a comment, the reality star said, "It needs to be clear and noted how much she paid and if she can even recite the books of the Bible off the top of her head. That's all."</p><p>Fans took to the comments of a post on gossip Instagram account @theneighborhoodtalk to speak their minds on the subject. The account posted the story along with screenshots of White's original post and Raqi's comments. Most people were not having it. "Itâ€™s really crazy how people literally rise up from the dead just to tear people down," wrote one user. Another chimed in to agree, "Just clap for her and keep it movin. We got to do better." Do you think White paid for her degree? And if so, should we care? Sound off in the comments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoNygZNmmKeflaGubsPHoqueZZGYsLa%2FxJ1kqJ5dpa66tc2gZJ%2BnomKxprPRnpw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fangela-white-aka-blac-chyna-accused-of-paying-for-degree.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fangela-white-aka-blac-chyna-accused-of-paying-for-degree.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fangela-white-aka-blac-chyna-accused-of-paying-for-degree.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fangela-white-aka-blac-chyna-accused-of-paying-for-degree.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fangela-white-aka-blac-chyna-accused-of-paying-for-degree.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fangela-white-aka-blac-chyna-accused-of-paying-for-degree.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bret-hart-says-goldberg-shouldn-t-be-in-wwe-hall-of-fame-because-he-hurt-people.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bret-hart-says-goldberg-shouldn-t-be-in-wwe-hall-of-fame-because-he-hurt-people.html>Bret Hart Says Goldberg Shouldnt Be In WWE Hall Of Fame Because He Hurt People</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ai-s-relentless-rise-gives-journalists-tough-choices.html>AI's relentless rise gives journalists tough choices</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ai-s-relentless-rise-gives-journalists-tough-choices.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
