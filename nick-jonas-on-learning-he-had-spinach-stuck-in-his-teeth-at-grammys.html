Fans quickly noticed the mistake and took to social media to point it out.</p><p>“No one checked my teeth,” said Jonas. “Here’s the thing that’s really frustrating about this, OK. First of all, there was spinach in my teeth from my breakfast, which I ate hours before. So the entire day, no one thought to be like, ‘Hey man, there’s something back there.'”</p><p>Jonas also revealed that he learned during an interview a few weeks ago that his brothers checked their teeth before going onstage. “I sat there going, ‘Excuse me?'” he recalled. “They left me out of it.”</p><p>He then reflected on the night of the Grammys. Following their performance, Jonas talked to his manager backstage. “We were really excited because the performance went pretty well and it was like our Grammy moment. Our return,” he said. “I was so amped and I was like, ‘What’d you think?’ and he’s like, ‘Well, just don’t check–.'”</p><p>Jonas immediately went to check his phone and learned about the spinach. “The first message on my phone was from <a href=# id=auto-tag_adam-levine data-tag=adam-levine>Adam Levine</a>. He’s like, ‘Nice performance. You had a little schmutz in your teeth,'” he recalled.</p><p>“It just goes to show you that you can be performing on the Grammys and be nominated and still have spinach in your teeth,” Jonas concluded.</p><p></p><p>Jonas and Fallon also competed against each other in a game of “Slay It, Don’t Spray It” during the appearance.</p><p>The host explained that they would take turns singing popular songs. While most of the lyrics were available in front of them on cue cards, they had to finish some of the lyrics on their own. If the players didn’t sing the correct lyrics, water was shot at their faces. Meanwhile, the players who sang the lyrics correctly avoided being sprayed and the water was instead shot at their competitor.</p><p>The singer kicked off the game by performing Katy Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl.” Jonas correctly sang the lyrics to the 2008 song, so water was shot in Fallon’s face.</p><p>Fallon was next challenged to finish the lyrics to Train’s “Drops of Jupiter.” He had a difficult time reading the cue cards because his protective glasses were wet from being shot at with water. The host messed up the lyrics “one without a permanent scar,” so water was once again sprayed on his face.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Jonas sang Fall Out Boy’s “Sugar, We’re Going Down” for his second round. After Jonas successfully finished the lyrics, Fallon again had water sprayed on his face.</p><p>The host redeemed himself when he correctly finished the lyrics to the Jonas Brothers’ “Sucker” and Jonas was sprayed in the face. “Say the word and I’ll go anywhere blindly,” Fallon repeated the lyric after Jonas was sprayed. “Look who’s blind!”</p><p>The game concluded with Jonas and Fallon singing a duet of Panic! At the Disco’s “High Hopes.” Both players struggled to sing the correct lyrics, so water was sprayed in both of their faces.</p><p></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2BjtqS3jKOmp5mjYrmmrdGnoKefXZ2ybrTAnWSsqJmjrqS0jKyrrpubYrWqv4ytnJ6smGKutXnGq5impamoenJ%2Bl2pqanFf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnick-jonas-on-learning-he-had-spinach-stuck-in-his-teeth-at-grammys.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnick-jonas-on-learning-he-had-spinach-stuck-in-his-teeth-at-grammys.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnick-jonas-on-learning-he-had-spinach-stuck-in-his-teeth-at-grammys.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnick-jonas-on-learning-he-had-spinach-stuck-in-his-teeth-at-grammys.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnick-jonas-on-learning-he-had-spinach-stuck-in-his-teeth-at-grammys.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnick-jonas-on-learning-he-had-spinach-stuck-in-his-teeth-at-grammys.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./patience-ozokwor-s-biography-age-husband-children-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./patience-ozokwor-s-biography-age-husband-children-net-worth.html>Patience Ozokwors biography: age, husband, children, net worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./merrill-osmond-net-worth-2024.html>Merrill Osmond Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./merrill-osmond-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
