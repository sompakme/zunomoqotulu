<time>31 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>There is always a unique feature that sets every star apart, in the case of musician, sheet designer and TV personality, Paul Abrahamian, his long beard and glaring tattoo are his defining traits.&nbsp;The bearded star hit the nail on the head with popularity when he entered the Big Brother show for five consecutive seasons from 2016 to 2018. He is the first among the guest house members to make it to the finals in two contests without coming out. winner.&nbsp;in the 18th and 19th seasons where he was named runner-up twice.&nbsp;He holds the record for the candidate who spent the longest time at home – 191 days.</span></p><p><span>As a television personality, he appeared on&nbsp;</span><span>The Bold and the Beautiful,</span><span>&nbsp;a popular CBS show on October 25, 2017. Along with Da’Vonne Rodgers, a former Big Brother show contestant, Paul Abrahamian took part at the premiere of the CBS television series,&nbsp;</span><span>Candy Crush.&nbsp;</span><span>This was featured as part of a special event with former Survivors and Big Brother on set.</span></p><p><span>Prior to his stint in Big Brother, he featured as part of a rock bank popularly called Reviver where he served as a guitarist.&nbsp;Paul Abrahamian was on Absolute Punks’ 2013 “New Music” list.&nbsp;Six months earlier, The Beard Mag had featured him as a bearded model in one of their publications.&nbsp;Paul is also a clothing designer.&nbsp;His design skills are evident in his clothing line called Dead Skull Apparel.&nbsp;Since bursting into the limelight, Paul has won millions of hearts and remains a favorite among the ladies who follow him on social media.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What is his net worth?</span></strong></h2><p><span>You’ll find that the reality TV star has an estimated net worth of $500,000, but some sources have placed his total net worth at $1 million.</span></p><p><span>A closer look at his earnings shows that he makes an average of $200,000 a year on his official website, Dead Skull Apparel.&nbsp;Her stint on Big Brother in 2016 earned her $50,000 for being a finalist.&nbsp;He also won a similar cash prize for getting the same job on the 19th season of Big Brother.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family and relatives</span></strong></h2><p><span>There isn’t much to tell in terms of details of his family life, but according to what we can glean from the records, he was born into a Muslim family and raised in his hometown of Tarzana, California.&nbsp;There are no details about his parents and other family members, but his birth in the United States makes Paul Abrahamian an American citizen and he is of mixed ethnicity.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wife or girlfriend, is Paul Abrahamian gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Before joining the Big Brother guests, Paul Abrahamian was romantically involved with Oana Gregory who makes a living as a Romanian-American actress.&nbsp;As long as their relationship lasted, they shared photos of their good times together on social media.&nbsp;That’s what happened in 2014 when the Romanian-American actress posted photos of her bearded lover.</span></p><p><span>Later, they started uploading files which highlighted the fact that they were no longer together.&nbsp;These messages led fans to conclude that their dalliance had ended, but neither Paul nor Oana came forward to clarify the assumptions.&nbsp;So we have no way to confirm if they are still together or not.</span></p><p><span>Apart from his reliance on the Romanian-American actress, the reality TV name was linked to that of fellow countryman, Big Abbott, Christmas Abbott.&nbsp;The duo really showed an unusual level of closeness in the house, which caused a lot of speculation among fans who concluded that Abbot had become Paul’s new lover.&nbsp;But from what’s obvious, the reality TV star is still visibly single and has no record of a past marriage.</span></p><p><span>Paul Abrahamian’s name has never been associated with being gay;&nbsp;His sexuality is believed to be straight, especially when his romantic relationship with Oana is considered.&nbsp;Also, he is not known to be a supporter of gay rights, which clearly indicates that he is not remotely interested in the same-sex relationship.</span></p><p class=postsid
