In a remix of <span data-scayt_word="Kirkman's" data-scaytid=4>Kirkman’s</span> source material, <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=6>Negan</span> winds up arriving at the Alexandria Safe Zone to confront Rick after learning the latter was mounting an army. Only <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=7>Negan</span> arrives with two members of Rick’s camp — Sasha and Eugene — in a bid to use both against Rick and his people. At the same time, <span data-scayt_word=Jadis data-scaytid=10>Jadis</span> and the Garbage People turn on Rick. <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=8>Negan</span>&nbsp;then outlines a long list of demands — including Daryl meeting Lucille — in exchange for Sasha. &nbsp;</p><p>Sasha, who was adamant about not being used as a pawn against her people, winds up taking Eugene’s poison pill before they leave the Sanctuary. Much to <span data-scayt_word="Negan's" data-scaytid=12>Negan’s</span> surprise, Sasha winds up having already been turned into a walker by the time he attempts to use her against Rick in the pending war. In a nice callback, Sasha sees visions of her late love interest Abraham (Michael <span data-scayt_word=Cudlitz data-scaytid=13>Cudlitz</span>) as well as Maggie (Lauren <span data-scayt_word=Cohan data-scaytid=14>Cohan</span>) as she ponders life before downing the pill and transforming. (She also almost accomplishes her mission of taking <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=11>Negan</span> out after turning into a walker and nearly biting him.) In the end, Maggie — in a season of devastating losses — winds up having to be the one to put Walker Sasha down for good as she is poised to take over as the leader at the Hilltop.</p><p>Sasha’s death sets off the beginning of the famed “All-Out War” arc from <span data-scayt_word="Kirkman's" data-scaytid=16>Kirkman’s</span> comic series in which Rick and company go to battle against <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=17>Negan</span> with freedom on the line. The fierce fight — which kicks off with Carl (Chandler Riggs) firing the first shot — sees Rick and Rosita (Christian <span data-scayt_word=Serratos data-scaytid=20>Serratos</span>) both shot (though their injuries are not serious), after Eugene (Josh <span data-scayt_word=McDermitt data-scaytid=21>McDermitt</span>) encouraged his former camp to surrender.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Following the gunfight, <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=22>Negan</span>&nbsp;lines Rick and his son Carl up on their knees in a callback to the season seven opener in which Abraham and Glenn (Steven <span data-scayt_word=Yeun data-scaytid=27>Yeun</span>) were killed off. At the same time, Rick hears a woman fall from a rooftop and believes it to be <span data-scayt_word=Michonne data-scaytid=28>Michonne</span> (<span data-scayt_word=Danai data-scaytid=106>Danai</span> <span data-scayt_word=Gurira data-scaytid=30>Gurira</span>). As <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=23>Negan</span> is about to Lucille Carl, Rick doubles down on his vow to kill the leader of the Saviors: “You’re all already dead,” he says.</p><p>Right when things look dire for Rick and Carl, help finally arrives in the form of Ezekiel (<span data-scayt_word=Khary data-scaytid=108>Khary</span> Payton), his tiger Shiva, Carol (Melissa McBride) and the rest of the Kingdom army, who are joined by Maggie (Lauren <span data-scayt_word=Cohan data-scaytid=31>Cohan</span>), Jesus (Tom Payne) and the Hilltop forces. The group effort delivers a victory for the good guys as the Saviors along with&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Jadis data-scaytid=32>Jadis</span> (Pollyanna McIntosh) and her Garbage People retreat. The epic battle marked the first time that all three groups united in a season that largely focused on either smaller groups of characters or one specific community.</p><p>Following a brief time jump, Maggie previews the war ahead to the Hilltop residents and viewers see the Kingdom, Hilltop and Alexandria coexisting peacefully as the dead are mourned, the wounded recover and Ezekiel, Maggie and Rick hold court and warn of the war ahead. The finale ends with Maggie holding the watch that <span data-scayt_word=Hershel data-scaytid=36>Hershel</span>&nbsp;(Scott Wilson) gave to Glenn as she explains why her people came to support the <span data-scayt_word=Alexandrians data-scaytid=37>Alexandrians</span>: “Glenn made the decision, Rick. I was just following his lead.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>With that, the stage is set for <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=38>Negan</span> 2.0 in the previously announced eighth season of the zombie drama. Morgan has already announced that he will return next season when the series takes on <span data-scayt_word="Kirkman's" data-scaytid=39>Kirkman’s</span> “All-Out War” arc. This portion of the source material runs 12 issues and [spoiler alert] ultimately sees the <span data-scayt_word=Alexandrians data-scaytid=42>Alexandrians</span> — paired with the Kingdom and the Hilltop — come out on top as <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=43>Negan</span> ultimately becomes a prisoner held in a cell within Alexandria (which would likely be the same the cell Morgan built last season).</p><p>As a whole, season seven forced Rick’s group to explore the politics of living and fighting a ruthless villain unlike any other foe they had faced up until this point. While <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=46>Negan</span> governs using fear and violence, Rick’s people had to teach the Hilltop residents (save for their cowardly leader Gregory) along with Ezekiel and the Kingdom dwellers how to fight — and perhaps more important, why they needed to take down the Saviors. Sasha ultimately represented the price that came with fighting for a free democracy and a future (including Maggie’s unborn baby) as both Carol (McBride) and Morgan (<span data-scayt_word=Lennie data-scaytid=134>Lennie</span> James) realized that a potential victory could lead to the violence-free lives they so desperately want.&nbsp;</p><p>All told, season seven’s series regular death toll comes in at four: Sasha, Spencer (Austin Nichols), Glenn and Abraham.</p><p>For her part, Martin-Green joined The Walking Dead in season three as a recurring player before being promoted to regular in season four. The actress <a href=#>originally auditioned</a> for the role of <span data-scayt_word=Michonne data-scaytid=49>Michonne</span> — which went to <span data-scayt_word=Danai data-scaytid=50>Danai</span> <span data-scayt_word=Gurira data-scaytid=51>Gurira</span> — but <span data-scayt_word=then-showrunner data-scaytid=55>then-showrunner</span> Glen <span data-scayt_word=Mazzara data-scaytid=56>Mazzara</span> created the role of Sasha, the sister of comic book favorite <span data-scayt_word=Tyreese data-scaytid=57>Tyreese</span> (Chad Coleman).
