This may deter a rabbit from returning to the same location. The majority of sprays are sprayed directly to the plant’s leaves and blooms, but be sure to read the label for specific application instructions.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>The question that follows is whether or not rabbits will consume SunPatiens.</h3><p>Colorful impatiens (Impatiens walleriana) lure rabbits to your flowerbeds and containers, but they can fast devour all of your hard work if you don’t keep an eye on them. Growing deterrent plants isn’t always the most effective method of keeping them away, since hungry rabbits may consume the deterrent plants in the first place.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Also, do you know whether vinca deer and rabbit are immune to it?</h3><p>Vinca is an Italian word that means “vineyard” (Vinca minor) Animals are unlikely to nibble on this ground cover because of the leathery texture of the evergreen leaves and the toughness of the creeping stems.</p><p></p><h3>What vegetation do rabbits dislike, when seen in this light?</h3><p>The following are examples of plants that rabbits prefer to avoid: Vegetables: asparagus, leeks, onions, potatoes, rhubarb, squash, tomatoes, and other root vegetables are available.
