A viral video of her declaring, “Ain’t nobody got time for that!” became viral, gaining millions and millions of views on YouTube alone. Having that many people looking at you may have a profound impact on your life.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What’s more, where has the Ain nobody got time for that woman disappeared to?</h3><p>That’s not something anybody has time for. There is a popular YouTube video showing Kimberly “Sweet Brown” Wilkins being interviewed after escaping a fire in an apartment building. The video has gained widespread attention. It first broadcast on KFOR-TV, an NBC station in Oklahoma City, on April 8, 2012 at 8:00 p.m.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>In the same vein, what does “ain’t nobody got time for that” really mean?</h3><p>“Nobody has the time for it!” it implies. The remark became well-known as a result of its frequent use in the aforementioned television programme.</p><p></p><h3>Isn’t it true that Ain’t anyone got time for that is protected by copyright?</h3><p>“Sweet Brown, a viral video celebrity, is suing Apple for alleged copyright violation.”</p><p>In a lawsuit filed against Apple Inc., an Oklahoma lady who gained Internet popularity with the tagline “Ain’t nobody got time for that!” claims the company did not have authorization to profit from a musical mashup of her wacky television appearance.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the estimated net worth of Sweet Brown?</h3><p>Inheritance and Earnings She has amassed a substantial amount of riches as a result of her online celebrity. Even though we were unable to locate the actual statistics of her earnings, we estimate that her net worth is in the neighbourhood of $2 million.</p><p></p><h3>There were a total of 10 related question answers found.</h3><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What exactly is cold pop?</h3><p>Anything from a vending machine or ice chest that is cold to the touch, delicious, and very satisfying when you wake up at 3:30 a.m. to the smell of neighbours barbecuing at your apartment complex, only to discover that “oh, lord jesus – it’s a fire” and you have to flee for your life, forgetting your shoes and everything else</p><p></p><h3>So, what did Sweet Brown have to say?</h3><p>I said, “Oh my God, there’s a fire.” Then I went out the door, I didn’t grab any shoes or anything, I just fled for my life, as Jesus would say. And then the smoke got the better of me, and I ended up with bronchitis, which nobody has time for.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the whole meaning of the word Ain’t?</h3><p>This information comes from Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia. In the common English language vernacular, the phrase ain’t is a contraction for the words am not, is not, are not, has not, and have not, as well as for the words am not, is not, are not, and have not. In various dialects, the word ain’t is also used as a contraction of the words do not, does not, and did not, among other things.</p><p></p><h3>What exactly does it mean to “dash someone” imply?</h3><p>put a damper on someone’s hopes Disappoint or disillusion someone by destroying their plans.

Add a noun to the end of the noun phrase, and it is complete: It is a top-secret document, and it is associated with a top-secret organisation.</p><p></p><h3>Is the hyphen in check off a hyphen?</h3><p>Check-in may be either an adjective or a noun when it is hyphenated. When used as a noun, it refers to the act of registering upon arriving at the destination. It denotes an item that is utilised for this function when used as an adjective. “If you come after 4 p.m., you will be charged a $50 late check-in fee,” the receptionist informed us.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6wn6hlmah6tbTEZqOanKliwamt02aqmqGUYq6qutNmpaian5nGbrPOrWStoZ2aeqe70WaroZmkY7W1ucs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-the-lady-that-said-ain-t-nobody-got-time-for-that.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-the-lady-that-said-ain-t-nobody-got-time-for-that.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-the-lady-that-said-ain-t-nobody-got-time-for-that.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-the-lady-that-said-ain-t-nobody-got-time-for-that.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-the-lady-that-said-ain-t-nobody-got-time-for-that.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-lady-that-said-ain-t-nobody-got-time-for-that.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aiden-fucci-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-fatally-stabbing-tristyn-bailey.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aiden-fucci-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-fatally-stabbing-tristyn-bailey.html>Aiden Fucci sentenced to life in prison for fatally stabbing Tristyn Bailey</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-dr-cain-on-the-resident-morris-chestnut-debuts-new-character.html>Who is Dr. Cain on The Resident?
