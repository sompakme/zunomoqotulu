They have everything your household needs. And it can be a great place to work. But can just anyone work there?</p><p>Unfortunately, not. Like most retailers, Bed Bath and Beyond do have some restrictions on who they employ.</p><p>So, read on to discover the answer to the burning question…</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-work-at-bed-bath-and-beyond.png alt="how old do you have to be to work at bed bath and beyond" width=1000 height=1500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=toc_title>Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#>How Old Do You Have To Be To Work At Bed Bath and Beyond?</a><ul><li><a href=#>What’s the reason?</a></li><li><a href=#>Are you experienced?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#>What Jobs Are Available?</a><ul><li><a href=#>Store associate</a></li><li><a href=#>Making the shop look good too…</a></li><li><a href=#>Stock associate</a></li><li><a href=#>Are you a suitable candidate?</a></li><li><a href=#>Cashier</a></li><li><a href=#>Got the skills?</a></li><li><a href=#>Interested?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#>How Much Does A Job At Bed Bath and Beyond Pay?</a><ul><li><a href=#>Rates of pay</a></li><li><a href=#>Not a newbie?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#>Does Bed Bath and Beyond Offer Any Employee Benefits?</a><ul><li><a href=#>So, what do you get?</a></li><li><a href=#>The downside?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#>Want To Achieve The Highest Sales At Work?</a></li><li><a href=#>Final Thoughts</a></li></ul><h2><span id=How_Old_Do_You_Have_To_Be_To_Work_At_Bed_Bath_and_Beyond>How Old Do You Have To Be To Work At Bed Bath and Beyond?</span></h2><p>The youngest a Bed Bath and Beyond employee can be is 16 years old. However, many stores prefer their employees to be at least 18. They also like staff to have a high school diploma as well.</p><h3><span id=What8217s_the_reason>What’s the reason?</span></h3><p>Well, a lot of it is to do with local labor laws. Each state has different rules about how old you have to be to gain employment. And these rules can be hard to navigate. It’s easier for hiring managers just to choose not to hire minors. That way, there’s no chance of them falling foul of any labor laws. It protects the company and protects employees as well.</p><p>If you’re unsure about the rules in your state, check out the<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Department of Labour website</a>. This handy government website has all the information you need. Just search for your state to find out what is allowed near you.</p><h3><span id=Are_you_experienced>Are you experienced?</span></h3><p>There’s another reason too. Many managers want to hire staff with a bit of both work, and life, experience. If you’re a minor, it’s unlikely you’ll have the same background as some over the age of 18.</p><p>Plus, Bed Bath and Beyond is a company that likes to hire from within. If a supervisory position becomes available, they prefer to promote existing staff than hire someone new. To get one of those higher-up roles, you will need a high school diploma or GED.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-work-at-bed-bath-beyond.png alt="how old do you have to be to work at bed bath beyond" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span id=What_Jobs_Are_Available>What Jobs Are Available?</span></h2><p>Once you’ve checked that you’re old enough, then congratulations! You’re ready to take the first step and apply. But <strong>what kind of jobs do Bed Bath and Beyond have</strong>?</p><h3><span id=Store_associate>Store associate</span></h3><p>Store associates are the face of Bed Bath and Beyond. They’re the first person a customer sees, so they need to be open, smiling, and well-presented. They should have great communication skills and be comfortable talking to strangers.</p><p>This role involves a lot of dealing with customers. You’ll have to help them find what they need, take them to the correct place in the store, and be able to explain key features of various products. You’ll likely be handling customer complaints too, so the ability to stay calm in a difficult situation is vital.</p><h3><span id=Making_the_shop_look_good_too>Making the shop look good too…</span></h3><p>But it’s not just speaking to clients. Store associates are also responsible for making the shop look good. You need to keep displays looking awesome so that the merchandise is as appealing as possible.</p><p>This position would suit a confident, polite person who enjoys talking to others. You should have a tidy mind and be well-organized at all times. And it’s key to be warm and welcoming, with great listening skills.</p><h3><span id=Stock_associate>Stock associate</span></h3><p>Not much of a people person? Then perhaps a position in the stock room is best for you. Stock associates are responsible for the merchandise the store sells.</p><p>On a typical day, you’ll spend time unloading stock and arranging it in the back. You’ll have to verify it’s all present and correct and check for any damages. From there, it’s your job to get that merch out into the correct place on the shop floor.</p><h3><span id=Are_you_a_suitable_candidate>Are you a suitable candidate?</span></h3><p>You’ll need to be methodical and enjoy following procedures. It’s important to follow Bed Bath and Beyond protocols, so you should be good at taking instructions. You should also be detail-oriented and have an eye spotting anything out of the ordinary.</p><p>While this isn’t primarily a customer-facing role, you will have to speak to them sometimes. If a client approaches you for help, then you’ll have to assist them in a kind and courteous manner. You may need to jump on the till from time to time too, so cash-handling skills are desirable.</p><h3><span id=Cashier>Cashier</span></h3><p>Good with numbers? Then how about a job on the tills. Cashiers take care of handing products at the point of sale.</p><p>Experience in cash handling is pretty important for this role. You’ll be taking money from customers and ensuring you hand back the correct change. You also need to take and scan coupons, as well as process returns.</p><h3><span id=Got_the_skills>Got the skills?</span></h3><p>A cashier must be a people person. You wrap up the customer’s store experience, so it’s imperative to be friendly, inviting, and polite. You should also be good at de-escalating situations when faced with an angry customer.</p><p>And attention to detail is important too. You’ll be packaging the guest’s item, so make sure that everything is in good condition. And it should go without saying that you’ll have decent math ability as well!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-work-at-the-bed-bath-beyond.png alt="how old do you have to be to work at the bed bath beyond" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span id=Interested>Interested?</span></h3><p>If you’re ready to apply, then head straight to the recruitment section of the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bed Bath and Beyond website</strong></a>. It has an extensive list of every opportunity the brand currently has available. Just search by location, job type, or hours required to work to see what’s out there.</p><h2><span id=How_Much_Does_A_Job_At_Bed_Bath_and_Beyond_Pay>How Much Does A Job At Bed Bath and Beyond Pay?</span></h2><p>The hourly rate for a <strong>position at Bed Bath and Beyond</strong> is based on where you live and the role you’re performing. As you may already know, most states set their minimum wage (though some, like Idaho, use the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour).</p><p>If you’re not sure and want to check, head to the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Department of Labor website</a>. They have a list of the minimum wage in every state. There’s also historical information, so you can see how much wages have (or, more likely, have not) risen over the years.</p><h3><span id=Rates_of_pay>Rates of pay</span></h3><p>As a store associate, you can expect to receive anything between your state’s minimum wage and about $14 per hour. The rate of pay for a cashier is pretty much the same, with the average being about $10 per hour. For stock associates, you’re probably looking at something around $9-$14 per hour.</p><p>If this is your first job, then you should expect to start at the lower end of the pay scale. But you can work up to a higher rate the longer you work there. That pay grade will go up with time served.</p><h3><span id=Not_a_newbie>Not a newbie?</span></h3><p>However, if you already have previous experience, then there’s some wiggle room. Having done a similar job before is a great bargaining chip. Hiring managers expect you to negotiate, so don’t settle for their first offer.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that you will probably need that experience to get hired in the stock room. Bed Bath and Beyond like its stock associates to know what they’re doing. And most stock associates are over 18 years old, as there’s a lot of heavy lifting involved in this position.</p><h2><span id=Does_Bed_Bath_and_Beyond_Offer_Any_Employee_Benefits>Does Bed Bath and Beyond Offer Any Employee Benefits?</span></h2><p>It sure does! Bed Bath and Beyond take care of their employees. In fact, the benefits package is pretty awesome here.</p><h3><span id=So_what_do_you_get>So, what do you get?</span></h3><p>There’s medical, dental, visual, and life insurance for a start. Then there’s both long-term and short-term disability insurance. There’s also a company-matched 401k plan for when you retire. They’re quite generous when it comes to time off, too. Employees get paid sick days, as well as vacations and public holidays. And if you need to take some personal days, they pay you for those as well.</p><p>And if you’re willing to work during the holidays, then there’s a fantastic bonus scheme. On certain dates, staff gets an extra $2 per hour! If you don’t mind giving up your holiday time, then it’s a good way to make a bit of extra dough.</p><h3><span id=The_downside>The downside?</span></h3><p>These benefits only apply to full-time staff. Part-timers still get some perks, but not all of them. So, if you’re a teenager still in school, it’s unlikely that you’ll qualify. Still, you’ll get the employee discount at least. That’s better than nothing, right?</p><h2><span id=Want_To_Achieve_The_Highest_Sales_At_Work>Want To Achieve The Highest Sales At Work?</span></h2><p>Well, firstly, I’ve put together some great job descriptions to help you better decide which role you’d like to apply for.
