For instance, mutable water sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pisces</a>&nbsp;are often portrayed as spaced-out dreamers and hot messes. However, the truth of the matter is that every sign has its strengths and weaknesses. Pisces, ruled by spiritual Neptune, falls at the tail end of the astrological cycle, signifying an unparalleled level of innate wisdom and mysticism. Those born between February 18 and March 20 — or who have other Pisces placements in their&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>birth chart</a>&nbsp;— are compassionate, romantic, artistic, intensely empathic, and sensitive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're similarly intuitive, empathetic, imaginative, and unapologetically emotional, you'll likely click with a Piscean person. (It also bears noting that your sun sign is just one piece of a really complex, nuanced puzzle known as your natal, or birth, chart. It's worth glimpsing over to see which house Pisces rules and if you have any planetary placements that connect with the mutable water sign.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, Pisces' compatibility with all 12 signs of the zodiac.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-aries-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Aries Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pisces is semisextile, or one sign apart from cardinal fire sign Aries, which can be rather awkward. Aries is an independent self-starter who's driven to achieve, and Pisces goes with the flow, preferring to see what the tide brings. Aries would prefer to deal with matters that are right in front of them, while Pisces can't help but be intensely aware of subtext, psychological matters, and underlying emotions. It's the push-pull between the very first sign of the zodiac and the very last. But if the two are open to seeing one another's perspective, Ram can help Pisces self-motivate, and Pisces might inspire the Ram to slow down and tap into their intuition.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-taurus-compatibility--ideal-match></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Taurus Compatibility — Ideal Match</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pisces is sextile, or two signs apart, from fixed earth sign, earthy&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taurus</a>, which can create a natural, friendly bond. Both signs are interested in taking it easy, prioritizing creature comforts and bonding time. Ruled by Venus, Taurus is relationship-oriented, which pairs well with Neptunian Pisces' tendency to prioritize a romantic view of their closest connections. The only time when they might butt heads is if Taurus struggles to adapt and Pisces gets frustrated by Taurus's focus on all things tactile over spiritual.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-gemini-compatibility--problematic-pair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Gemini Compatibility — Problematic Pair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pisces is square, or three signs apart, from&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gemini</a>, the air sign ruled by Mercury. Both are mutable signs and, therefore, adaptable and indecisive. The Fish and the Twins might struggle to make up their minds about everything, including their relationship. Pisces also leads with their imagination and deeply empathic heart, while Gemini is more rational and intellectually driven. So, they might cross wires when attempting to bond or talk through their feelings. Still, if they're committed to talking and doing the work of a relationship, this can be a curiosity-charged, whimsical match.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-cancer-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Cancer Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pisces is trine, or four signs apart, from&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cancer</a>, making for a natural, loving fit. Ruled by dreamy Neptune, the Fish is deeply spiritual, empathic, artistic, and emotional. As an initiating cardinal sign, Cancer can come up with ambitious game plans for making less decisive Pisceans's dreams come true. Pisces can teach Cancer to channel their, at times, overwhelming emotions into a healthy outlet, like art, music, dance, theater, or creative lovemaking. While they have their differences — Pisces might be turned off by Cancer's bossiness, and Cancer might find Pisces a bit too escapist — they ultimately speak the same heartfelt language.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-leo-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Leo Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pisces is quincunx, or five signs apart from&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Leo</a>, the fixed fire sign, denoting a need for constant adjustment to get in sync. Ruled by dreamy Neptune, the Fish is deeply spiritual, empathic, artistic, and emotional, all of which can feel occasionally inspiring or like a wet blanket to similarly heartfelt and creative but extremely driven and action-oriented Leo. What the two have in common is their vibrant imaginations and romanticism, so they could easily get caught up in seeing an imperfect bond through the same pair of rose-colored glasses.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-virgo-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Virgo Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pisces is opposite, or six signs apart, from&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Virgo</a>, the mutable earth sign, which makes them like two sides of the same coin. Ruled by dreamy Neptune, the Fish is deeply spiritual, empathic, artistic, and emotional, all of which can be very inspiring — or very confusing and disorienting — to rational, grounded, orderly Virgo. If they're willing to learn to speak one another's language, the combo of Pisces' spiritual water and Virgo's practical earth lays down fertile ground for a bond that flourishes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-libra-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Libra Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Libra</a>, the cardinal air sign, is quincunx, or five signs apart from Pisces, which is generally an awkward, confusing angle. While Libra is a take-charge initiator, Pisces is typically passive, waiting to see which hand they're dealt. While Libras are wired to connect, Pisces are very much in their feelings and would prefer escapism — and maybe staying in — over a see-and-be-seen event. Still, both are romantics and lovers of art, so it's possible for someone born under the sign of the Fish and someone born under the sign of the Scales to find a way to get along swimmingly.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-scorpio-compatibility--ideal-match></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Scorpio Compatibility — Ideal Match</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pisces is trine, or four signs apart, from fixed water sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Scorpio</a>, which is thought of as the most harmonious bond that can be forged between two signs. Both are deeply feeling, in touch with their spirituality, somewhat — or, OK, possibly very — psychic, and up for an otherworldly, jaw-droppingly romantic relationship. Scorp might be frustrated by Pisces' passive vibe, and Pisces can be overwhelmed by Scorpio's intensity, but in general, the Scorpion can help the Fish turn their vivid dreams into action, while the Fish can show the Scorpion the beauty of going with the flow.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-sagittarius-compatibility--problematic-pair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Sagittarius Compatibility — Problematic Pair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sag, the mutable fire sign, is square, or three signs apart from Pisces, a tense angle that might necessitate work in the relationship. Both are spiritually inclined and value beauty, emotion, and art. While Pisces can be very sensitive, impressionable, and empathic to the point that they find it hard not to be deeply affected by other people's pain, Sag is proudly blunt, a bit more cerebral than in their feelings, and philosophical as opposed to emotional. The Archer's direct, unfiltered approach to sharing their thoughts and feelings could rub the Fish the wrong way, and the Fish might come off as too delicate to the wild and free Archer. Yet, they can also challenge one another in a way that promotes growth.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-capricorn-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Capricorn Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Capricorn</a>, the cardinal earth sign, is sextile, or two signs apart from Capricorn, which makes for an easygoing bond. Both signs are committed to showing up for the people they care about in a traditional, heartfelt way. While the Fish is a dreamer who prefers escapism over reality, and Cap is all about taking slow, steady, pragmatic steps to reach their endgame, there's a lot these two can learn from one another. Pisces can help Cap hone their artistic eye, while Capricorn gives Pisces the tools to turn their fantasies into reality.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-aquarius-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Aquarius Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fixed air sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aquarius</a>&nbsp;is semi-sextile, or one sign apart, from Pisces, which makes for a little uneasiness. Although both are humanitarians and endlessly imaginative, the Water Bearer thinks in a very scientific, logical way, while the Fish is a dreamer through and through. However, Aquarius can learn adaptability from the Fish, while the Fish can learn to be more proactive in hitting their goals. If these two are willing to see the world through the other's lens, they could take even their wildest artistic idea and turn it into something real.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces-and-pisces-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces and Pisces Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two spiritual, dreamy Pisces might have a blast escaping from everyday reality by letting their super-active imaginations wander. They might be film (which is ruled by Neptune) or theater writing partners or cheering on one another's other artistic pursuits. They'll also show up for one another emotionally in a way that no other sign might be able to. Nonetheless, the drawback of this pairing is that it generally helps when at least one partner has their feet on the ground. So as long as one Pisces is more pragmatic — perhaps they have some earth in their natal chart — they'll find this to be a deeply fulfilling, productive match.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMSmwIynZLChnJl6pK3RnmSbnZGnwG65wKScrqhdmLytuMScq6Knng%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-and-worst-sign-matches.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-and-worst-sign-matches.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-and-worst-sign-matches.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-and-worst-sign-matches.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-and-worst-sign-matches.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-and-worst-sign-matches.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-far-is-iad-from-baltimore.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-far-is-iad-from-baltimore.html>How Far Is Iad From Baltimore</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./avril-lavigne-rocks-out-in-just-ripped-tights-and-hoodie.html>Avril Lavigne rocks out in JUST ripped tights and hoodie</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./avril-lavigne-rocks-out-in-just-ripped-tights-and-hoodie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
