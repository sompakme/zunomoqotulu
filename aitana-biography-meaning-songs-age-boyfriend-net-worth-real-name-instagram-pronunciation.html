She hails from the charming hamlet of Sant Climent de Llobregat, nestled in the verdant hills of Spain, and was blessed to be the only child of her loving parents, <strong>Cosme Ocaña</strong> and <strong>Belén Morales</strong>. Her childhood was spent in the quaint towns of Sant Climent de Llobregat and Viladecans, where she was groomed to become a star.</p><p>In 2017,&nbsp;<strong>Aitana</strong>&nbsp;shot to national fame when she participated in the revival series of the outstanding Spanish reality television talent show&nbsp;<strong>Operación Triunfo</strong>, where she displayed her impeccable musical prowess and enchanting stage presence, securing the second spot.</p><p>Her love for music began when she was merely a lass of 15, and she started uploading her soulful covers of popular songs to YouTube. She made a name for herself with her melodious voice, and in the same year, she published her original tracks, which left listeners awestruck.</p><p>The songstress then teamed up with the talented <strong>Ana Guerra</strong> to produce the sizzling single&nbsp;<strong>Lo Malo</strong>, which became an instant chartbuster and a strong contender to represent Spain in the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest. The track was a runaway success in Spain, where it debuted at number one and remained there for several weeks, cementing&nbsp;<strong>Aitana</strong>‘s reputation as a bona fide star.</p><p>Her mercurial rise to fame earned her a 360o record deal with the legendary Universal Music, and she went on to release her debut solo single, the enchanting&nbsp;<strong>Teléfono</strong>. The track was a commercial triumph and broke several streaming records, catapulting her to even greater heights of stardom.</p><p>In 2019,&nbsp;<strong>Aitana</strong>&nbsp;entered the music world with her debut studio album,&nbsp;<strong>Spoiler</strong>, which garnered a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. The accompanying concert tour was a smashing success, gracing numerous indoor stadiums across Spain, and even produced a video album,&nbsp;<strong>Play Tour: En Directo</strong>. Following this triumph, she continued her creative pursuits and released her second album,&nbsp;<strong>11 Razones</strong>, in late 2020, which included two top-five songs,&nbsp;<strong>Más</strong>&nbsp;by <strong>Cali Y El Dandee</strong> (<strong>Cali & el Dandee</strong>) and&nbsp;<strong>Corazón Sin Vida</strong>&nbsp;by <strong>Sebastián Yatra</strong>.</p><p>But&nbsp;<strong>Aitana</strong>‘s talents don’t stop there!
