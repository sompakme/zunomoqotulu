Kath had a lot of artistic genes transferred to her parents.&nbsp;His father William H. Moennig III makes the violin, a trade that may have a connection with his own father, William Moennig, who grew up in Markneukirchen, a small German town renowned for its musical instruments.&nbsp;Moreover, he is an amazing artist who can paint, draw and sculpt anything he sees.&nbsp;Mary Zahn, Kath’s mother, was a ballerina.</span></p><p><span>Did you know that Katherine Moennig is the first cousin of actors Gwyneth Paltrow and Jake Paltrow?&nbsp;Her father is the maternal half-sister of the famous actress Blythe Danner, mother of Gwyneth Paltrow.&nbsp;That makes Blythe and her brother Harry Danner, who are also Moennig’s half-aunts and uncles respectively.</span></p><p><span>Growing up on the 12th floor of an apartment building in Philly, Moening who became a tomboy from an early age would spend most of her time hanging out with her male neighbors.&nbsp;Her first interest in acting was sparked at the age of 10, when her best friend was motivating her to act in a children’s theater.&nbsp;However, Moennig wasn’t quite sure acting was what she wanted to do in the long term and much later in life.</span></p><p><span>For a long time in his teens, Moennig was unfocused.&nbsp;She didn’t seem very interested in academics and often sneaked out to hang out with friends who weren’t even her classmates.&nbsp;From time to time, she traveled to New York with these friends to attend parties.&nbsp;At some point in her life, she thought she would eventually become a doorman.</span></p><p><span>However, after high school, Moennig seemed to have decided what to do: pursue an acting career.&nbsp;It was her way of getting away from Philly where she didn’t want to be tempted to work in her father’s violin business.&nbsp;Her interest began to grow when she enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.&nbsp;She was 18 at the time.</span></p><p><span>Luckily for Moennig, her parents who had always understood her lack of interest in academics were supportive.&nbsp;Like most aspiring actors, Kath started out doing commercials, one of which was for the defunct Fleet Bank.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t long before Kath found herself in Hollywood.&nbsp;She greatly impressed in her first film role which came in the drama series&nbsp;</span><span>Young Americans</span><span>.&nbsp;Moennig has never looked back since.&nbsp;Some of his early films would include&nbsp;</span><span>Like It Tough</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Shipping News</span></p><p><span>Kath’s role as Shane McCutcheon in the lesbian series&nbsp;</span><span>The World</span><span>&nbsp;has become a big break in her career opening the door to more gigs that will soon follow.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is she gay/lesbian, engaged or married?</span></strong></h2><p><span>It’s no secret that Katherine Moening is openly gay/lesbian.&nbsp;She has portrayed a lesbian/queer/trans persona in a handful of movies and TV shows.&nbsp;Kath is quite secretive when it comes to her romantic life.&nbsp;However, over the years, she has been linked to a number of women.</span></p><p><span>Among them, Holly Miranda, Amanda Moore and Evan Rachel Wood.&nbsp;The latter, although short-lived, generated a lot of media interest.&nbsp;Reporters saw them (pictured) on a date outside a restaurant in West Hollywood, California in October 2014. Wood had come out as bisexual three years ago in 2012.</span></p><p><span>Moennig’s relationship with Woods reportedly ended in November of that year.&nbsp;However, the two remain close friends.&nbsp;Based on the facts we have gathered, Katherine Moennig is likely single at the time of writing this article and not engaged or married.&nbsp;Meanwhile, it seems her dogs and cats are making sure her celibacy isn’t boring.&nbsp;Her Instagram feed says it all.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMpJitoJWntq%2BxjKamnqaenrRutdJmqqGdXZyuunnLnqqboZGjeqa6xpqenpxdpL9uucCrqaKdlGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-katherine-moennig-is-she-gay-lesbian-engaged-or-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-katherine-moennig-is-she-gay-lesbian-engaged-or-married.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-katherine-moennig-is-she-gay-lesbian-engaged-or-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-katherine-moennig-is-she-gay-lesbian-engaged-or-married.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-katherine-moennig-is-she-gay-lesbian-engaged-or-married.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-katherine-moennig-is-she-gay-lesbian-engaged-or-married.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-x-factor-the-band-we-found-kelli-marie-on-instagram-fri-13-december-2019-21-10-hel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-x-factor-the-band-we-found-kelli-marie-on-instagram-fri-13-december-2019-21-10-hel.html>The X Factor: The Band We found Kelli Marie on Instagram!
