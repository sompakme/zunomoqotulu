That being <a href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> as Laurie Strode and her battle with Michael Myers. The movie was a critical success, rightfully so, as well as a box office one as well. The hope is to catch lightning in a bottle with their take on The Exorcist.</p><p>“[It’s] going to be like David’s Halloween sequel,” Blum says to <a href=#>Den of Geek</a>. “I think it’s going to pleasantly surprise all the skeptics out there. We had a lot of skeptics about Halloween and David turned them around, and I think he’s going to turn it around with The Exorcist.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/exorcist-light-900x506.jpg><p>Remakes and reboots are almost always met with derision. Many fans rail that Hollywood has run out of ideas, so recycling classics is what they have to fall back onto. It’s been a non-ending point of contention that doesn’t look to end any time soon. But sometimes, rare as they may be, a reboot or remake can strike gold.</p><p>If you ask Blum, though, he doesn’t consider taking on what many feel like the greatest and scariest movie of all time as a daunting task. “I love to do [these] kinds of movies because people are very emotional about it,” he says. “I think it’s a high bar and it’s a challenge to do the movie. Remember, most of the audience coming to this—95 percent of the audience who will, if we do our job right, come to see this movie—will not have seen the first Exorcist or even heard of it.”</p><p>His point was proven with Green’s 2018 Halloween, which garnered the two upcoming follow-ups, <a href=#>Halloween Kills </a>set to premiere on October 15, 2021, and Halloween Ends, scheduled to come out exactly one year later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/regan-floating-900x506.jpg><p>In 1973, director William Friedkin and author/screenwriter William Peter Blatty literally scared the bejesus out of audiences when they had the demon Pazuzu possess 12-year-old Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) to levels of horror never seen before on film.</p><p>William Peter Blatty first wrote the <a href=#>best-selling novel</a> of the possessed young girl, then turned his best-seller into what is routinely considered, especially from a certain generation, the scariest movie of all time. The story followed Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow), an aging Catholic Priest who, on an archeological dig in the ancient city of Hatra, comes across a sculpture of the terrifying demon, Pazuzu.</p><p>The story then turns to Regan, her mother Chris (Ellen Burstyn), and a younger priest, Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller), who has been struggling with his own faith. As Regan begins to show signs of possession, her mother and doctors feel Regan is experiencing psychological trauma. But after a series of tests, the doctors are unable to pinpoint any issue. Enter Father Karras.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/regan-devil-exorcist-900x667.jpg><p>What follows is something audiences of 1973 were unprepared for. The language and shocking level of violence, all religious-based, caused many to simply get up and walk out of the theater. Heart attacks were reported, physical sickness in movie theaters was reported. The Exorcist left an indelible mark on a generation of movie-goers.</p><p>While The Exorcist tore into moviegoers, what followed was quite underwhelming and, in fact, was lauded as one of the <a href=#>worst sequels</a> in movie history. We are talking about, of course, The Exorcist II: The Heretic, which brought back Linda Blair as Regan and was more famous for the unintended laughs than any semblance of horror.</p><p>Filmmakers then brought out the respectable The Exorcist III, which was more of a detective piece than a horror movie. In the early 2000s, two movies were produced (actually it was one movie cut twice) called Exorcist: The Beginning and Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist, both telling virtually the same story about a young Father Merrin. There was also a well-received, but short-lived <a href=#>TV series</a> of The Exorcist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/exorcist-tv-show-900x506.jpg><p>Jason Blum knows his audience of today. He also knows that there will be many fans of the original who are not down with this idea. He hopes to bring in fans from both sides and he is fully confident that Green is the man to make it happen. “I want to make a movie that works for both [audiences],” Blum said to <a href=#>Den of Geek</a>. “I want to make a movie for people that know and love the first Exorcist and are furious that we’re doing this, but somehow drag themselves to the theater. I want them to come out happy. And I want to make a movie that people who’ve never heard of The Exorcist really enjoy. I think David did that with Halloween. I think he’ll do that with The Exorcist also.”</p><p>There is no set timeframe as to when Blum, Green, and the still unannounced cast will start filming. Green, as expected, is still fully entrenched with his Halloween trilogy and it is unknown if The Exorcist will actually be his next project or not. The big question will be, as it is with all remakes and reboots and continuations – how do you top the original?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ismJp6psTOq5qiq6Riv6auzqirZ6Ckork%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-exorcist-is-getting-rebooted-by-another-horror-reboot-director.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-exorcist-is-getting-rebooted-by-another-horror-reboot-director.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-exorcist-is-getting-rebooted-by-another-horror-reboot-director.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-exorcist-is-getting-rebooted-by-another-horror-reboot-director.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-exorcist-is-getting-rebooted-by-another-horror-reboot-director.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-exorcist-is-getting-rebooted-by-another-horror-reboot-director.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-key-to-success-for-brides-of-2013.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-key-to-success-for-brides-of-2013.html>The key to success for brides of 2013</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./queen-letizia-celebrates-17th-wedding-anniversary-with-king-felipe-best-photos-from-their-royal-we.html>Queen Letizia celebrates 17th wedding anniversary with King Felipe - best photos from their royal we</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./queen-letizia-celebrates-17th-wedding-anniversary-with-king-felipe-best-photos-from-their-royal-we.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
