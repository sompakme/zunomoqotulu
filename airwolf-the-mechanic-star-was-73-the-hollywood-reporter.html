He was 73.</p><p>Vincent died Feb. 10 of cardiac arrest at Mission Hospital’s Memorial Campus in Asheville, North Carolina, according to his death certificate obtained by The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>Vincent had a very public battle with drug and alcohol abuse and his career was already on the wane when he was drunk and involved in a 1996 car accident in Mission Viejo, California, that broke his neck and damaged his vocal cords.</p><p>Twelve years later, Vincent was in another car crash, then contracted an infection that led to two sections of his right leg being amputated. He spent his final years broke and living in the South.</p><p>Things were much different in the <span data-scayt_word=mid-1970s data-scaytid=2>mid-1970s</span>, when Vincent was poised on the cusp of <span data-scayt_word=superstardom data-scaytid=3>superstardom</span>. A chiseled heartthrob with a mane of flowing hair, he capitalized on his hunky image by appearing shirtless in photos and on the big screen, and the agent who&nbsp;discovered&nbsp;him also discovered&nbsp;James Dean.</p><p>Vincent portrayed up-and-coming characters in Michael Winner’s The Mechanic (1972), as the too-ambitious <span data-scayt_word=protege data-scaytid=4>protege</span> of contract killer Charles Bronson; in Vigilante Force (1976), as Kris <span data-scayt_word=Kristofferson’s data-scaytid=5>Kristofferson’s</span> brother; and in Hooper (1978), as a <span data-scayt_word=stuntman data-scaytid=6>stuntman</span> mentored by Burt Reynolds.</p><p>Vincent also starred as a popular high school jock opposite Joan <span data-scayt_word=Goodfellow data-scaytid=7>Goodfellow</span> in the tragic love story Buster and Billie (1974), directed by Daniel <span data-scayt_word=Petrie data-scaytid=14>Petrie</span>; played the rebel trucker <span data-scayt_word=Carrol data-scaytid=15>Carrol</span> Jo Hummer in the violent White Line Fever (1975); and went along with being mistaken for a Marine Corps hero in Baby Blue Marine (1976).</p><p>After a bit of a career lull, the blue-eyed Vincent played naval officer Robert <span data-scayt_word="Mitchum's" data-scaytid=25>Mitchum’s</span> black-sheep son and wooed Ali <span data-scayt_word=MacGraw data-scaytid=31>MacGraw</span> on the acclaimed ABC 1983 miniseries The Winds of War, adapted from Herman <span data-scayt_word="Wouk's" data-scaytid=32>Wouk’s</span> best-selling work of <span data-scayt_word=1930s data-scaytid=33>1930s</span> fiction.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>He then was cast as <span data-scayt_word=Stringfellow data-scaytid=38>Stringfellow</span> <span data-scayt_word=Hawke data-scaytid=39>Hawke</span> — the pilot of a high-tech, CIA-created Bell 222 helicopter and the brother of a missing Vietnam vet — on <span data-scayt_word=Airwolf data-scaytid=45>Airwolf</span>, created by TV action maestro Donald P. <span data-scayt_word=Bellisario data-scaytid=50>Bellisario</span>. The series, which also starred Ernest <span data-scayt_word=Borgnine data-scaytid=51>Borgnine</span>, aired from 1984-86, and Vincent at the time was among the highest-paid actors on television.</p><p>But with all his troubles, his career would never be the same after <span data-scayt_word=Airwolf data-scaytid=54>Airwolf</span>.</p><p>“He had tremendous natural ability, and that was his curse,” David Grove, author of the 2016 book Jan-Michael Vincent: Edge of Greatness, said in a January 2017 <a href=# rel=nofollow>podcast interview</a> with Phil Hall. “When you are born with natural ability, there’s a tendency to get by on that. It’s like a well; when it’s dry, there’s nothing left, because you’ve never worked to build that foundation.”</p><p>Vincent was born in Adams, Colorado, on July 15, 1945, according to his death certificate, and raised in <span data-scayt_word=Hanford data-scaytid=63>Hanford</span>, California, about 30 miles south of Fresno. His father, a bomber pilot in World War II, owned a sign-painting business.</p><p>Vincent graduated from <span data-scayt_word=Hanford data-scaytid=68>Hanford</span> High School in 1963, went to Ventura College in Southern California when he wasn’t surfing and served with the National Guard. He then met Dick Clayton — who had discovered Dean, Lee Majors, Tuesday Weld and many others — and the talent agent got the virile youngster into the training program at Universal Studios.</p><p>In 1967, Vincent was in a Hardy Boys TV movie and made his movie debut opposite Robert Conrad in the Mexico-set The Bandits. A year later, he guest-starred on Lassie and Bonanza, appeared in Universal’s Journey to Shiloh and was a regular on Danger Island, a serial that ran on Saturday mornings on The Banana Splits Adventure Hour.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>After working opposite John Wayne and Rock Hudson in The Undefeated (1969) and playing Lana Turner’s son on the short-lived ABC drama The Survivors, Vincent won notice when he played a hippie-type Marine opposite Darren <span data-scayt_word=McGavin data-scaytid=77>McGavin</span> in the 1970 ABC telefilm Tribes.</p><p>He then played <span data-scayt_word="Mitchum's" data-scaytid=78>Mitchum’s</span> son for the first time in Going Home (1971).</p><p>In his ‘<span data-scayt_word=70s data-scaytid=80>70s</span> heyday, Vincent also starred as a Tarzan-like character in Disney’s The World’s Greatest Athlete (1973) and appeared in the well-regarded endurance horse race <span data-scayt_word=actioner data-scaytid=81>actioner</span> Bite the Bullet (1975). He also <span data-scayt_word=toplined data-scaytid=82>toplined</span> the post-apocalyptic Damnation Alley (1977), and in John <span data-scayt_word=Milius data-scaytid=83>Milius</span>‘ Big Wednesday (1978), he played a self-destructive surfer, a role perhaps too close to home.</p><p>Vincent reportedly was Universal’s choice to portray oceanographer Matt Hooper in Jaws (1975), but Steven Spielberg went with the more-nerdy Richard <span data-scayt_word=Dreyfuss data-scaytid=84>Dreyfuss</span> instead. (The character was a <span data-scayt_word=studly data-scaytid=85>studly</span> guy in the Peter <span data-scayt_word=Benchley data-scaytid=86>Benchley</span> best-seller on which the movie is based.)</p><p>Vincent appeared in Buffalo ’66 (1998), but most of his final efforts were lower-budget <span data-scayt_word=actioners data-scaytid=87>actioners</span> and thrillers, many of which went straight to video.</p><p>Survivors include his wife, Patricia.</p><p>Duane <span data-scayt_word=Byrge data-scaytid=88>Byrge</span> contributed to this report.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKutzWakopuYlrKtedWipZydnql6pbHAnWSaoaKsvK2yjKacnKCRo7akedKtmKtlp5bAboOSZmhpaGNphnF7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fairwolf-the-mechanic-star-was-73-the-hollywood-reporter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fairwolf-the-mechanic-star-was-73-the-hollywood-reporter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fairwolf-the-mechanic-star-was-73-the-hollywood-reporter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fairwolf-the-mechanic-star-was-73-the-hollywood-reporter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fairwolf-the-mechanic-star-was-73-the-hollywood-reporter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fairwolf-the-mechanic-star-was-73-the-hollywood-reporter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amber-rose-lists-ice-spice-glorilla-as-dream-collabs-blames-men-for-female-artist-drama.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amber-rose-lists-ice-spice-glorilla-as-dream-collabs-blames-men-for-female-artist-drama.html>Amber Rose Lists Ice Spice &amp;amp; GloRilla As Dream Collabs, Blames Men For Female Artist Drama</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tech-n9ne-is-at-his-prime-on-outdone.html>Tech N9ne Is At His Prime On &amp;quot;Outdone&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tech-n9ne-is-at-his-prime-on-outdone.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
