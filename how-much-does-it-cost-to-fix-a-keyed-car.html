It can significantly reduce the value and aesthetic appearance of your vehicle. Unfortunately, vandalism and intentional damage are common occurrences in our society, leading car owners to wonder how much it costs to fix a keyed car.</p><p>The cost of fixing a keyed car varies depending on several factors, such as the severity and extent of the damage, the type of car, and the location of the scratch. A minor scratch can be fixed with a simple touch-up paint job, while a deep scratch may require more extensive work, such as sanding and repainting.</p><h3><span id=Factors_That_Affect_the_Cost_of_Fixing_a_Keyed_Car>Factors That Affect the Cost of Fixing a Keyed Car</span></h3><p>There are several factors that can influence the cost of fixing a keyed car, such as:</p><h4>The Extent of the Damage</h4><p>The severity and length of the scratch determine the amount of work required. Deeper and longer scratches may require more in-depth and detailed repair work.</p><h4>The Type of Car</h4><p>The type of car you own can also affect the cost of repairs. Luxury cars often require specific paint and repair materials, resulting in higher repair costs.</p><h4>The Location of the Scratch</h4><p>The location of the scratch can also influence the repair cost.
