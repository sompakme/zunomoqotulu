She was 92.</p><p>Rae, who earlier earned two Tony <span data-scayt_word=noms data-scaytid=1>nominations</span> and played Woody Allen’s mother in Bananas (1971) and a long-suffering wife on the classic sitcom Car 54, Where Are You?, revealed in April 2017 that she had been diagnosed with bone cancer, seven years after a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.</p><p>“Now, at the age of 91, I have to make up my mind,” she said in a statement at the time. “I’m not in any pain right now. I’m feeling so terrific and so glad to be above ground. Now I have to figure out whether I want to go have treatment again or opt for life. I love life. I’ve had a wonderful one already … I’ve had a great life, but I have so many wonderful things happening. I’d like to choose life. I’m grateful for the life I’ve already had.”</p><p>Rae originated the character of Edna Garrett in 1978 for NBC’s <span data-scayt_word=Diff’rent data-scaytid=2>Diff’rent</span> Strokes and then went on to play her for seven seasons on the Facts of Life <span data-scayt_word=spinoff data-scaytid=3>spinoff</span>. In 1982, she received an Emmy nomination for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series.</p><p>Debuting in 1979, Facts of Life revolved around a group of teenage girls attending a private New York boarding school. Guiding them through the trials and tribulations of adolescence was Edna Garrett, their no-nonsense, but always understanding, housemother. (A <a href=# rel=noopener>reboot is in the works</a> at Sony.)</p><p>In a 1982 interview with the Spartanburg (S.C.) Herald, Rae reflected on the character that had made her a star.</p><p>“I want to bring in as much humanity as possible, as well as the humor,” she said. “I’ve tried to make her a human being with dimensions. The way they write her now is with a great deal of sensitivity and understanding. But I don’t want her to be Polly Perfect, because she must have human failings and make mistakes.</p><p>“She’s also a surrogate mother to the girls. I told them I wanted to be firm with the girls because I know it’s important. Parents must lay down ground rules for their children to help them to grow up and to learn responsibility for their actions. They must learn to stand on their own two feet.”</p><p>Born Charlotte Rae <span data-scayt_word=Lubotsky data-scaytid=4>Lubotsky</span> in Milwaukee on April 22, 1926, she was one of three daughters of Russian Jewish immigrants.</p><p>Rae caught the acting bug early, performing with the Children’s <span data-scayt_word=Theatre data-scaytid=5>Theatre</span> of <span data-scayt_word=Wauwatosa data-scaytid=6>Wauwatosa</span> and acting on the radio. As a teenager, she won a summer apprenticeship with the Port Players, a professional summer theater company. She also was a regular on stage at Shorewood High School.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>In 1944, Rae headed to Northwestern University and studied alongside the likes of Charlton Heston, Paul <span data-scayt_word=Lynde data-scaytid=7>Lynde</span>, Patricia Neal, Jeffrey Hunter, Agnes Nixon and future Fiddler on the Roof lyricist Sheldon <span data-scayt_word=Harnick data-scaytid=10>Harnick</span>. Her roommate was <span data-scayt_word=Cloris data-scaytid=13>Cloris</span> <span data-scayt_word=Leachman data-scaytid=14>Leachman</span>. (Decades later, <span data-scayt_word=Leachman data-scaytid=15>Leachman</span> would replace Rae for the final two seasons of Facts of Life.)</p><p>Around 1948, Rae made the decision to leave school to seek fame and fortune in New York. A versatile singer and dancer, she could often be seen at the Blue Angel or the Village Vanguard.</p><p>In 1951, Rae married film composer and music editor John Strauss. The couple had two sons, Larry and Andrew. Rae and Strauss stayed together for more than 25 years until he revealed that he was bisexual and wanted an open marriage. They divorced in 1976.</p><p>Rae made her <a href=# id=auto-tag_broadway data-tag=broadway>Broadway</a> debut in 1952 in the musical comedy Three Wishes for Jamie, then followed with a turn as Mrs. <span data-scayt_word=Peachum data-scaytid=16>Peachum</span> in the 1954 revival of The Threepenny Opera. The cast also included Bea Arthur, John <span data-scayt_word=Astin data-scaytid=17>Astin</span> and Paul Dooley. In 1956, she created the role of Mammy <span data-scayt_word=Yokum data-scaytid=19>Yokum</span> in the original Broadway production of <span data-scayt_word=L’il data-scaytid=20>L’il</span> <span data-scayt_word=Abner data-scaytid=21>Abner</span>.</p><p>Rae received the first of two Tony <span data-scayt_word=noms data-scaytid=18>noms</span> in 1966, as best featured actress in a musical for <span data-scayt_word=Pickwick data-scaytid=23>Pickwick</span>. The second came in 1969 when she was nominated as best actress in a play for Morning, Noon and Night.</p><p>In 1955, Rae recorded the album Songs I Taught My Mother. Subtitled Silly, Sinful and Satiric Selections, it featured songs by Cole Porter, Lorenz Hart & Richard Rodgers, Marc <span data-scayt_word=Blitzstein data-scaytid=25>Blitzstein</span>, Vernon Duke and <span data-scayt_word=Harnick data-scaytid=24>Harnick</span>.</p><p>Rae also began her extensive television career in the 1950s, with appearances on The United States Steel Hour and The Phil Silvers Show. A role that really brought her attention came in 1961 when she was cast as Sylvia <span data-scayt_word=Schnauser data-scaytid=28>Schnauser</span>, the wife of Officer Leo <span data-scayt_word=Schnauser data-scaytid=29>Schnauser</span>, played by Al Lewis, in the NBC sitcom Car 54, Where Are You?</p><p>“I was doing a lot of drama until I took the comedy role in the series Car 54, Where Are You?, and I’ve been tagged as a comedian ever since,” she said in 1985.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>When not appearing onstage, Rae worked steadily in television throughout the <span data-scayt_word=1960s data-scaytid=30>1960s</span> and ‘<span data-scayt_word=70s data-scaytid=31>70s</span> on such series as The Defenders; The Partridge Family; McMillan & Wife; Love, American Style; All in the Family; Good Times; and Barney Miller. She played Molly the Mail Lady on Sesame Street and was a regular on The Rich Little Show. In 1975, she received an Emmy nomination for her performance in the telefilm Queen of the Stardust Ballroom.</p><p>Rae also popped up in features, taking on comedic roles in Bananas as well as&nbsp;Hello Down There (1969), Jenny (1970),The Hot Rock (1972) and Hair (1979).</p><p>Rae was a favorite of legendary TV producer Norman Lear. The two had met in the <span data-scayt_word=1950s data-scaytid=32>1950s</span> when he was writing for The Colgate Comedy Hour. In addition to giving her guest shots on his sitcoms, Lear cast her as Mrs. <span data-scayt_word=Bellotti data-scaytid=36>Bellotti</span> in Hot L Baltimore, the short-lived 1975 adaptation of <span data-scayt_word=Lanford data-scaytid=39>Lanford</span> Wilson’s hit 1973 play.</p><p>In 1978, Fred Silverman, then president of ratings-laggard NBC, was high on a sitcom concept called 45 Minutes From Harlem, about a wealthy, white New York industrialist who becomes a foster parent to two orphaned African-American boys who were children of a former employee. The show was being fashioned for Maude co-star Conrad Bain and a newly discovered child actor, Gary Coleman.</p><p>Silverman wanted Lear to produce. To entice him, Silverman cast Rae as the household’s wisecracking maid. The ploy worked, and Lear’s company, Tandem Productions, produced the show.</p><p>Rae remembered the unusual meeting where she secured the part. At the time, she was filming a guest spot for The Eddie <span data-scayt_word=Capra data-scaytid=40>Capra</span> Murder Mysteries and showed up in costume to audition for the role of Mrs. Garrett. “They didn’t have me read, we just talked, and they asked me about how I felt this housekeeper should be with these two boys and with Mr. Drummond [Bain’s character], and I told him the way I felt. The next thing I knew, I had the part.”</p><p>Rounding out the cast were Todd Bridges as Willis, the older brother of Coleman’s character Arnold, and Dana Plato as Kimberly, the biological daughter of Drummond.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Diff’rent data-scaytid=43>Diff’rent</span> Strokes became a hit shortly after debuting in November 1978. Coleman was the breakout star as his catchphrase, <span data-scayt_word=“Wha’chu data-scaytid=46>“Wha’chu</span> <span data-scayt_word=talkin data-scaytid=47>talkin</span>‘ ’bout, Willis?” became part of TV history. But as the first season unfolded, the growing popularity of Edna Garrett became apparent. The producers designed an episode with an eye towards a <span data-scayt_word=spinoff data-scaytid=45>spinoff</span>.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>The season’s last entry, “The Girls School,” found Mrs. Garrett meeting and bonding with a group of youngsters at East Lake School for Girls, a prestigious prep school that Kimberly was attending. NBC execs liked what they saw and ordered a series. The Facts of Life debuted the following August.</p><p>Though the basic premise of Edna Garrett guiding the girl’s through life’s traumas remained throughout its run, the sitcom evolved throughout its nine seasons. The first season featured seven young girls in the cast, including a young Molly <span data-scayt_word=Ringwald data-scaytid=49>Ringwald</span>. By the second season, four of those girls were gone. The three that remained included Lisa <span data-scayt_word=Whelchel data-scaytid=52>Whelchel</span> as Blair, the spoiled rich girl; Kim Fields as gossip <span data-scayt_word=Tootie data-scaytid=58>Tootie</span>; and Mindy Cohn as the naive Natalie. Nancy <span data-scayt_word=McKeon data-scaytid=59>McKeon</span> was added as Jo, a rough-around-the-edges Bronx girl. Mrs. Garrett also transformed from housemother to the school’s dietician.</p><p>In season five, Mrs. Garrett went into business for herself, creating Edna’s Edibles, a gourmet food shop. Season seven saw the introduction of Blair’s cousin Geri Tyler, who had cerebral palsy. Played by Geri Jewell, who also had the disorder, it marked the first time a character with a disability had a recurring role on a series.</p><p>By season seven, Rae was feeling that her character was getting stale and asked that her role be reduced. The producers decided to write her out entirely, marrying off Mrs. Garrett and sending her to Africa to work in the Peace Corps. <span data-scayt_word=Leachman data-scaytid=63>Leachman</span> was introduced as Garrett’s sister, Beverly, who came in to take over the shop and watch over the girls.</p><p>After leaving Facts of Life, Rae remained busy, with work on TV shows including 101 Dalmatians: The Series; ER; The King of Queens; Murder, She Wrote; Sisters; and Girl Meets World; and such films as You Don’t Mess With the <span data-scayt_word=Zohan data-scaytid=67>Zohan</span> (2008), Love Sick Love (2012) and <span data-scayt_word=Ricki data-scaytid=68>Ricki</span> and the Flash (2015).</p><p>As syndication fueled the popularity of Facts of Life, Rae was lured back to play the character that had made her a star. She revisited Mrs. Garrett in 1982 with The Facts of Life Goes to Paris and in 2001 for The Facts of Life Reunion. Rae skipped 1987’s The Facts of Life Down Under (that one featured <span data-scayt_word=Leachman data-scaytid=53>Leachman</span> as her sister).</p><p>In 2015, Rae released her memoir, The Facts of My Life. Written with her son Larry Strauss, it revealed her struggle to come to grips with her husband’s sexuality and her battle with alcoholism.</p><p>In addition to her son Larry and his wife, Eleanor, survivors include her sister, Miriam, and grandchildren Sean, Carly and Nora. Her other son Andrew died in 1999 of a heart attack.</p><p>In lieu of flowers, her family asked that donations be made to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Actors Fund</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Pancreatic Cancer Action Network</a> (Pan-Can) or the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Clare Foundation</a>.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKS0wKujqKykmnqzrcRmm56ZlGKzoq%2FTrGSloZaaenmFlWpoamc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffacts-of-life-actress-was-92.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffacts-of-life-actress-was-92.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffacts-of-life-actress-was-92.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffacts-of-life-actress-was-92.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffacts-of-life-actress-was-92.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffacts-of-life-actress-was-92.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./arielle-vandenberg-age-wiki-net-worth-bio-height-fiance.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./arielle-vandenberg-age-wiki-net-worth-bio-height-fiance.html>Arielle Vandenberg Age | Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Fiance</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./which-phillies-players-also-played-for-the-guardians-mlb-immaculate-grid-answers-july-31.html>Which Phillies players also played for the Guardians?
